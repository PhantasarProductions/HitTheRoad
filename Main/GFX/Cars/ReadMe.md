# Cars

Here are the car sprites.
Due to the 16 color requirement I set for myself I could not rely on any features LOVE2D may offer to do this smoothly. This could not 100% guarantee only the default 16 EGA colors would be used. So I had to come up with a separate sprite for each car in the respective color. It's maybe a little bit amateuristic, but hey, that's part of the challenge. ;)

I shall admit I used a car model from the public domain. I converted that model into pcx then I went adapting it in dpaint so I could be sure I had all cars in the default 16 colors. Of course I did do a few pallete swaps. Literally in this case. That didn't matter for this challenge, as the output would still be the same 16 colors only.

Transparency has been added in the png files in order to make sure Love2D would do that part properly. There is a price to pay when using modern programming tools on old style graphics.
