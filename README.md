# HitTheRoad

Hit The Road will be a game written for the LOVE2D engine.
This is a future project for which only a few preparational files may appear in this repository.

There is no true date yet set for the start of this project.

The project is meant to be quite retro, with 16 color graphics. Long live EGA!
The music contributions will be very likely in the chiptune class, or music that comes close to the old Adlib sounds. As music is not my strongest thing, I am a bit reliant on what I can get here.

More stuff will be revealed as the project will take shape.
