# Icons

This directory contains the icons used for the Mac and Windows distributions.
Linux does not have a real icon system, but for menu system png files are mostly used. Just pick one from the cars folder in the graphics department, will ya :P

## Mac

MacOS, MacOSX, OS X, well they change the name all the time, but anyway the OS for Mac (nobody can get me for that one) uses the HitTheRoad.icns file.

# Windows

Windows uses the .ico file, although the LoveBuilder I use is not able to set that icon in by itself (it's for that reason the alpha and beta versions for Windows just use the Love icon in stead). The program Resource Hacker can put it in for ya.
