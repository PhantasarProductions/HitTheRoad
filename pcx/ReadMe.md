# PCX Files

In order to get the best RETRO feel for me in creating the 16 color graphics, I've decided to use DeluxePaint for DOS (while running DOSBox) for this project. However DPaint (as we also call it for short) only supports PCX and LBM, and LOVE2D supports neither. As LBM  has too many compatibility issues with the software I need to convert the graphics to PNG, PCX will have to do, and that stuff will be converted to PNG for usage in the game itself.

All these PCX files will be 16 color pictures, without transparency (PCX does not support that) and also with the default EGA palette. It is quite possible (as most graphic conversion software is "INTELLEGENT" (READ: Very stupid doing things I don't want)) the PNG picctures may have a little bit off the standard palette. That is something I cannot help. I hate intelligent software, but what can I do?

None of the PCX files will be included in the .LOVE file
